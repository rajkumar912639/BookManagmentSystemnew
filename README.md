A book management system on C++ is a software application that allows users to perform various operations on books, such as adding, deleting, updating, searching, sorting, and displaying them. A book management system on C++ can be implemented using object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. A book management system on C++ can also use data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables, to store and manipulate the books efficiently. A book management system on C++ can have a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the users. A book management system on C++ can have various features, such as:

- Adding a new book to the system with details such as title, author, publisher, ISBN, price, and availability.
- Deleting an existing book from the system by entering its ISBN or title.
- Updating the information of an existing book by entering its ISBN or title and modifying its details.
- Searching for a book in the system by entering its ISBN, title, author, or publisher and displaying its details.
- Sorting the books in the system by their ISBN, title, author, publisher, price, or availability in ascending or descending order.
- Displaying all the books in the system or a subset of them based on some criteria.
